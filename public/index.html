                    <h2>Technology Leadership</h2>
                    <p>Loren has run technology organizations at two important New York digital agencies, HUGE and Alexander Interactive.</h2>

                    <h3>Loren at HUGE</h3>
                    <p>When Loren joined <a href="http://www.hugeinc.com">HUGE</a>, they had practically no full stack development capabilities, and no experience with building out a technology services offering.  <strong>Loren built up full-stack development capabilities within the agency</strong>, ranging from the way tech was sold, through how it was managed, through the technology capabiliites offered.  By the end of Loren's tenure at HUGE, they were regularly taking on full stack development.</p>

                    <h3>Loren at Alexander Interactive</h3>
                    <p>Loren joined <a href="http://www.alexanderinteractive.com">Alexander Interactive (Ai)</a> when it was roughly 10 people, and participated in its growth through about 35 people.  At Ai's first Director of Technology, <strong>he established the processes and personnel that let the department grow into an e-commerce powerhouse.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Loren at Django-NYC</h3>
                    <p>Early on Loren identified the Python-based web framework <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> as an important new technology. Seeing a gap in the local community, <strong>Loren co-founded <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-nyc/">Django-NYC</a></strong>, a NYC-based users group that is still active today.</p>

                        <div class="media-body">
                            <p>Noticing the lack of <strong>a common language for describing contextual applications</strong> (such as those that are enabled by ACE), Loren developed a means of expressing such applications based on the metaphor of a natural language conversation, called <strong>Conversational Architecture</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Building on this approach, <strong>Loren developed a whiteboard-friendly visual design language</strong> for articulating contextual app behavior using the conversational metaphor.  Called <a href="http://cave-language.axilent.com">CAVE Language</a> (Conversational Architecture Visual Expression), it allows application designers from different disciplinary backgrounds (Business, UX, Tech etc.) to discuss contextual applications in a common language.</p>
                            <p>Loren recently presented CAVE Language at World IA Day in New York City. The <a href="https://youtu.be/XfJrLLgqilw?t=50m8s">video of his talk is on YouTube</a>, and the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/LorenDavie/conversational-architecture-world-ia-day-2016-nyc">slides can be found on SlideShare</a>.</p>
